\section{logging: 报告状态、错误和信息消息}
\subsection{日志系统的组成}
The logging system consists of four interacting types of objects. Each module or application that wants to log some activity uses a Logger instance to add information to the logs. Invoking the logger creates a LogRecord, which holds the information in memory until it is processed. A Logger may have a number of Handler objects configured to receive and process log records. The Handler uses a Formatter to turn the log records into output messages.
