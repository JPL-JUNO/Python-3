\section{Decorating functions}
\subsection{Memoization using decorators}
Memoization is a simple trick for remembering results to make code run a lot faster in specific scenarios. The basic trick here is to store a mapping of the input and expected output so that you have to calculate a value only once.
\section{Decorating class functions}
\subsection{Skipping the instance â€“ classmethod and staticmethod}
The difference between a classmethod and a staticmethod is fairly simple. The classmethod passes a class object instead of a class instance (self), and staticmethod skips both the class and the instance entirely. This effectively makes staticmethod very similar to a regular function outside of a class.
