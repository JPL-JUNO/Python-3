\subsection{dict-A map of items}
\begin{tcolorbox}
    To debug hash collisions, you can use the \verb|hash()| function paired with \verb|collections.Counter|. This will quickly show you where hash collisions occur but it does not take the dict probing sequence into consideration.
\end{tcolorbox}

In addition to the hash collision performance problem, there is another behavior that might surprise you. When deleting items from a dictionary, it wonâ€™t actually resize the dictionary in memory. The result is that both copying and iterating over the entire dictionary take O(m) time (where m is the maximum size of the dictionary); n, the current number of items, is not used.
